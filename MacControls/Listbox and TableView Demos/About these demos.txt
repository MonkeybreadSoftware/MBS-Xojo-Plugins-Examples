These projects, which all work both with Real Studio 2012r2.1 and later Xojo versions,
are for Mac OS X only. They all make use of the Cocoa-based NSTableView and NSOutlineView
controls for flat and hierarchical listboxes.

While Xojo's own ListBox is a custom-written control, NSTableView and NSOutlineView are truly
native to macOS, and therefore not only look better on a Mac system but also offer improved
behavior, including smoother scrolling (by pixel, not by line), animation, column re-ordering,
smarter sorting, and much more.


---------------
OutlineControl
---------------
The OutlineControl.rbp is a very simple demo to show how to build a hierarchical list using
NSOutlineView (which is a subclass of NSTableView).

-------------
Disk Browser
-------------
The Disk Browser.rbp is a more complete demo for a hierarchical list, showing the use of
contextual menus, editing, drag & drop and updating folder contents.

-------------------------
ListBox TableView (flat)
-------------------------
The "ListBoxTV TableView.rbp" project contains a near-complete replacement for Xojo's
ListBox control, along with many test cases for its various abilities. When you run it, you'll
see the TableView-based listbox at the top, and Xojo's Listbox below it. Both use mostly the
same code to set them up, so that you can easily compare their looks and behavior.
To use it in your own projects, copy the "ListBox_NSTableView" folder and paste it into your
project, then open your Windows there, and change the Super of the ListBox controls to "ListBoxTV"
(TV stands for TableView). That will switch them to using the native NSTableView. Then see if
your project still compiles and runs. Some things are not fully working yet - see the Notes
section in ListBoxTV about that.

-----------------------------------
ListBox OutlineView (hierarchical)
-----------------------------------
"ListBoxTV OutlineView.rbp" is an extended version of the flat ListboxTV with the ability
to support hierarchical Listboxes. If you only need non-hierarchical lists in your project,
use the TableView based code as it's a bit less complex and might also perform a bit faster.

--------------------------------------
ListBoxTV Simple Demo with DataSource
--------------------------------------
This is a simple demo to show how to make an on-demand listbox based on the flat ListBoxTV control.

-----------------------------------
ListBoxTV Database with DataSource
-----------------------------------
This is a more complex version of the flat ListBoxTV that shows how to browse an Sqlite database
without having to pre-fill all rows in advance but only fetch the rows that are currently to be
displayed in the listbox. This will significantly increase the performance of browsing DB tables
with thousands of rows.

--------------------------------------
ListboxTV with ContainerControl Cells
--------------------------------------
This demonstrates how to use arbitrary Views for every Cell, by using ContainerControls that
can virtually contain anything (Labels, Buttons, Chexkboxes, PopupMenus). The key to this is
found in the ListboxDemoWin.cocoaListbox.view event handler. You can apply the same technique
with the hierarchical (OutlineView) ListboxTV version as well.


If you find issues with the ListBoxTV control, or if you make improvements, please contact
me, and I'll make sure they get updated in the next MBS release.
